            Dear Delegates,
            I am Mehvish Munir, and I will serve as the President of the LUMUN society and conference this year.
            It is with absolute pleasure that I invite you to the 19th Annual Edition of LUMS Model United Nations
            (LUMUN). I am extremely excited to welcome you to the LUMS campus from December 29th to January 2, 2023.
        </p>

        <p>
            For nearly two decades, LUMUN has taken pride in its service to the Model UN culture of Pakistan as it is
            one of the most unique and academically renowned conferences within the Pakistani circuit. When the
            COVID-19 pandemic hit us, we faced many challenges. However, we stood in the face of adversity and
            arranged the conference online for two years, but I am so glad to welcome you all to the in-person edition.
            Our theme, “Tales of Survival, Hopes for Revival”, is centred around the idea of coming back to the
            in-person dynamics. As we step closer to the conference, we step closer to the traditions we uphold
            dearly.  Every year, delegates across Pakistan attend the LUMUN conference and discuss crucial
            international issues. They learn the art of negotiation and collaboration with their peers on
            the committee. They work together on drafting solutions and polishing their public speaking skills,
            and they also get to learn and engage at our committee-based panel talks.
        </p>

        <p>
            LUMUN is also back with its much-awaited social events because we truly believe in striking a balance
            between the academic and social aspects of the conference. LUMUN aims to provide avenues to learn and
            enjoy as the is much more than the debate inside our committee rooms. Under our LUMUN spirit this year,
            we will actively encourage you to interact with your fellow committee members and chairs at the social
            events and make memories that will last forever!
        </p>

        <p>
            My host team and I eagerly await your presence at LUMUN this year!
        </p>
        <p>
            Sincerely,
        </p>
        <p>
            Mehvish Munir,
        </p>
        <p>
            President LUMUN | 22-23
